        Learning any language is worth your time! Whether it’s French or another
        language, learning a language allows you to connect with people from all
        over the world, experience different cultures and help with a bit of
        brain training all at the same time! We’re living in an increasingly
        globalised world, so learning another language like French can help you
        to boost your career and the likelihood of finding a new job, make
        travelling much easier and it opens you up to a world of new
        entertainment, like music, art, books and films. Trust us, its
        definitely worth it.

      <h1 className="is-worth">Learning French at any age</h1>
      <p className="french-desc">
        You should remember that you can be ANY age and start learning a new
        language! The idea that there’s a cut-off point for language acquisition
        is incredibly common. People think that unless you learned a language
        when you were a child, there’s no hope and it’ll be near-impossible to
        grasp.
        <br />
        <br /> NEWSFLASH: That’s not the case! Learning French as an adult or
        young adult IS possible. You CAN grasp a language, no matter your age.
        The difference between adults learning and children learning is that
        children are pretty much fearless when it comes to making mistakes. Did
        you know that language anxiety affects around a third of adult learners?
        Because many of us have this fear, there’s a risk we miss out on
        learning key French words and phrases.
        <br />
        <br /> So whether you’re 5 or 50, you can learn French easily by
        consistently practising! The best way to learn French is to be mindful
        of the fact that languages are about more than just vocabulary and
        grammar. Languages like French are built around people, culture, and
        connection.
